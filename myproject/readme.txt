Some notes to self:

>python manage.py makemigrations
This command executes migration process

>python manage.py migrate
This executes the migration

> python manage.py createsuperuser
This command creates the username and password

I noticed that once the migration of the database was made to postgres, I could no longer start the server
in the default manner from the command prompt using the command
>python manage.py runserver


One thing is certain now, this is no longer a one page template as downloaded.
